# Multispecies population-scale emergence of climate change signals in an ocean warming hotspot

### About:

This is the home of supporting data/code used in the creation of figures and supplements in "Multispecies population-scale emergence of climate change signals in an ocean warming hotspot", accepted for publication in ICES Journal of Marine Science.

This repository will be updated when the publication is publicly available.

### Repository Organization:

#### R

The `R` directory contains the minimum code and documentation to recreate the figures and supplements included in this publication within two folders; `Analyses` and `Figures`.

##### Analyses

-   `distribution_significance_testing.R` uses the `annual_averages.rds` file derived from the NEFSC trawl survey data and performs a statistical t-test on distribution pre- and post-2010.

##### Figures

This folder contains the scripts to create the figures featured in the publication and supplemental materials, labeled by figure name.
